As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip their fiscal script WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a â€œfiscal conservative on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot underway among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBSâ€™ â€œFace the Nation,â€ drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense â€œdiscretionaryâ€ spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health, and environmental protection. The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: We going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,â€™â€ Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. Now, Democrats are saying thatâ€™s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent.
